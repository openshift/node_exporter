# Description: Expose metrics for number of boots of the system
# Dependencies: none
#
# The script creates one metric series which is the number of recorded
# boots in the /var/log/wtmp file. If wtmp is rotated, the next time the
# node exporter is restarted it will recalculate the value, and may over
# count restarts by one.
